Final clauses (i.e., expressing purpose) have their verbs in the subjunctive, introduced by *ut* when positive, by *ne* when negative.
>Example:
>Laborant pauperes ut divites fiant – poor men work to become rich.
>Se receperunt ne consilia ab hostibus cognoscerentur – they retreated in order that their plans might not be discovered by the enemy.
